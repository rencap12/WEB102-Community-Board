## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
- Had to remember destructuring brackets to get direct access to the props.
- Worked with trying to center the events without losing the integrity of the image
- Ensured that the styling for each of the attributes in the event display card (the button, link, text, image) were consistent with each other
